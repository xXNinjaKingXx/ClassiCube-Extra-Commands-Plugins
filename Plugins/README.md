# Installation

### How to install plugins:
**Step 1:** Put the plugin's .cs file into the **./plugins/** folder. If it's not there, make a new folder and put it in there.

**Step 2:** Either in-game or via the server console, type **/pcompile [plugin name]**. It should say "**Plugin compiled successfully.**", if it doesn't, make an issue [here](https://github.com/xXNinjaKingXx/ClassiCube-Extra-Commands-Plugins/issues).

**Step 3:** Now type **/pload [plugin name]**. It should say "**Plugin loaded successfully**".

## And you're done, enjoy your new plugin!
