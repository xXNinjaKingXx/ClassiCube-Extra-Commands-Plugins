# **Instructions for [Staff Plugin](https://github.com/xXNinjaKingXx/ClassiCube-Extra-Commands-Plugins/blob/main/Plugins/Staff.cs)**

**Step 1:** Open your server files and go to the text folder.

**Step 2:** Once you open the text folder create 3 new file's.

**Step 3:** Name the first file "[putranknamehere].txt", name the second file "[putranknamehere].txt", name the last file "[putranknamehere].txt"

**Notice:** You can name the files to a specific rank name but keep in mind there can only be one file per rank and you have to replace "[ranknamehere] (including the code also) with the rank you want it to show

# Installation

### How to install plugins:
**Step 1:** Put the plugin's .cs file into the **./plugins/** folder. If it's not there, make a new folder and put it in there.

**Step 2:** Either in-game or via the server console, type **/pcompile [plugin name]**. It should say "**Plugin compiled successfully.**", if it doesn't, make an issue [here](https://github.com/xXNinjaKingXx/ClassiCube-Extra-Commands-Plugins/issues).

**Step 3:** Now type **/pload [plugin name]**. It should say "**Plugin loaded successfully**".

## And you're done, enjoy your new plugin!
