# **Instructions for Staff Plugin**

**Step 1:** Open your server files and go to the text folder.

**Step 2:** Once you open the text folder create 3 new file's.

**Step 3:** Name the first file "[putranknamehere].txt", name the second file "[putranknamehere].txt", name the last file "[putranknamehere].txt"

**Notice:** You can name the files to a specific rank name but keep in mind there can only be one file per rank and you have to replace "[ranknamehere] (including the code also) with the rank you want it to show
