# Installation

### How to install plugins:
**Step 1:** Put the command's .cs file into the **./extra/commands/source** folder. If it's not there, make a new folder(s) and put it in there.

**Step 2:** Either in-game or via the server console, type **/compile [command name]**. It should say "**Command compiled successfully.**", if it doesn't, make an issue [here](https://github.com/xXNinjaKingXx/ClassiCube-Extra-Commands-Plugins/issues).

**Step 3:** Now type **/cmdload [command name]**. It should say "**Command loaded successfully**".

## And you're done, enjoy your new command!
